# State Persistence

1. Persistence Volumes
2. Persistence Volume claims

Let's look at volumes in the docker containers. The volumes in docker containers are meant to be only short period of time, only until the container is live. The data is destroyed along with the container. To persist the data present in the container, we attach a volume to the folder in the container. Even if the continer deleted the data generated still exists. 

Same applies for kubernetes

We attach a volume for the data generated by the pod. Even after the pod is deleted, the data remains.
